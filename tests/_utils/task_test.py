# DOCUMENTATION: This is kind of ğŸ’©ğŸ’©ğŸ’©
# Don't like it, don't keep it, if you can.
# This should be very easy by using unittest.mock the right way, but I failed ...
# I also failed at manually modifying the object's dicts.
# So the current solution just creates output files instead of mocking anything.
